This project was completed as part of The Odin Project curriculum located [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator). The goal of this project was to design and create a fully functional calculator with an intuitive user interface. Inspiration for the UI was taken from the well known IOS calulator app.
